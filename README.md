Unsupervised time series anomaly detection
This study introduces the Bag-of-Functions approach for anomaly detection in time series data. Utilizing the Bag-of-Functions method enhances data interpretability. We explore two variations: one combines the Bag-of-Functions baseline with a reconstruction error-based anomaly detection technique, while the other applies the Bag-of-Functions within a variational framework for anomaly detection. In the first method, reconstruction errors are used as anomaly scores, whereas the second method employs reconstruction probabilities as anomaly scores. Additionally, we implement and evaluate several existing statistical techniques and deep learning models to compare their performance. The methods are tested using the Sinewaves synthetic dataset and Yahooâ€™s S5 webscope real-world dataset.
